# Stock Parameters 

### Mortality and age:  maxage, R0, M, Msd

**maxage**: The maximum age of individuals that is simulated. There are maxage+1 (recruitment to age-0) age classes in the storage matrices. maxage is the plus group where all age-classes > maxage are grouped, unless option switched off with OM@cpars$plusgroup=0 . Single value. Positive integer.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 16</span>

Maximum age was set a little higher than the maximum observed age of 14 years. 




**R0**: Initial number of unfished recruits to age-0. This number is used to scale the size of the population to match catch or data, but does not affect any of the population dynamics unless the OM has been conditioned with data. As a result, for a data-limited fishery any number can be used for R0 . In data-rich stocks R0 may be estimated as part of a stock assessment, but for data limited stocks users can choose either an arbitrary number (say, 1000) or choose a number that produces simulated catches in recent historical years that are similar to real world catch data. Single value. Positive real number.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 1000</span>

Scaling parameter set at arbitrary value. 




**M**: The instantaneous rate of natural mortality. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.2, 0.31</span>

Natural mortality was specified for the range reported in the MSC pre-assessment SAI (2021). 




**Msd**: Inter-annual variation in M expressed as a coefficient of variation of a log-normal distribution. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. If this parameter is positive, yearly M is drawn from a log-normal distribution with a mean specified by log(M) drawn for that simulation and a standard deviation in log space specified by the value of Msd drawn for that simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.05, 0.1</span>

To address the possibility of M changing among years in these simulations we set a modest, arbitrary level of inter-annual variability with a lognormal CV of between 5% and 10% (i.e. 0.05 - 0.1), corresponding with 95% probability interval of +/-10% to +/- 20%.

 out <- knitr::knit_child(input) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(out)
```

### Recruitment: h, SRrel, Perr, AC

Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Values from 1/5 to 1.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.3, 0.9</span>

Highly uncertain parameter. Given current emphasis on surplus production modeling, a wide range for steepness was specified over which the performance of SP models could be evaluated. 




**SRrel**: Type of stock-recruit relationship. Use 1 to select a Beverton Holt relationship, 2 to select a Ricker relationship. Single value. Integer

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 1</span>

For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.6, 0.9</span>

No estimates for recruitment variability were available at time of OM specification. 
Bounds for this parameter were set to reflect highly variable recruitment.  




**AC**: Autocorrelation in the recruitment deviations in log space. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided, and used to add lag-1 auto-correlation to the log recruitment deviations. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.1, 0.6</span>

A wide range of values was used for auto-correlation in recruitment to reflect the uncertainty in this parameter.

### Maturity: L50, L50_95

**L50**: Length at 50% maturity. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. The L50 and L50_95 parameters are converted to ages using the growth parameters provided and used to construct a logistic curve to determine the proportion of the population that is mature in each age class.

The value drawn is then added to the length at 50% maturity to determine the length at 95% maturity. This parameterization is used instead of specifying the size at 95 percent maturity to avoid situations where the value drawn for the size at 95% maturity is smaller than that at 50% maturity. The L50 and L50_95 parameters are converted to ages using the growth parameters provided and used to construct a logistic curve to determine the proportion of the population that is mature in each age class.

### Stock depletion and Discard Mortality: D, Fdisc

**D**: Estimated current level of stock depletion, which is defined as the current spawning stock biomass divided by the unfished spawning stock biomass. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This parameter is used during model initialization to select a series of yearly historical recruitment values and fishing mortality rates that, based on the information provided, could have resulted in the specified depletion level in the simulated last historical year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers (typically < 1)

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.6, 0.76</span>

```

### Length-weight conversion parameters: a, b

**a**: The alpha parameter in allometric length-weight relationship. Single value. Weight parameters are used to determine catch-at-age and population-at-age from the number of individuals in each age class and the length of each individual, which is drawn from a normal distribution determined by the Linf , K , t0 , and LenCV parameters.

For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. For example, if Size_area_1 is 0.2, then 20% of the total area is allocated to area 1. Fishing can occur in both areas, or can be turned off in one area to simulate the effects of a no take marine reserve. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.

A mixed stock is assumed. 




**Frac_area_1**: The fraction of the unfished biomass in area 1. Please specify numbers between 0 and 1. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. For example, if Frac_area_1 is 0.5, then 50% of the unfished biomass is allocated to area 1, regardless of the size of area 1 (i.e, size and fraction in each area determine the density of fish, which may impact fishing spatial targeting). In each time step recruits are allocated to each area based on the proportion specified in Frac_area_1. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.5, 0.5</span>

A mixed stock is assumed. 




**Prob_staying**: The probability of individuals in area 1 remaining in area 1 over the course of one year. Please specify numbers between 0 and 1. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. For example, in an area with a Prob_staying value of 0.95 each fish has a 95% probability of staying in that area in each time step, and a 5% probability of moving to the other area. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive fraction.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.5, 0.5</span>

A mixed stock is assumed

# Fleet Parameters 

### Historical years of fishing, spatial targeting: nyears, Spat_targ

**nyears**: The number of years for the historical simulation. Single value. For example, if the simulated population is assumed to be unfished in 1975 and this is the year you want to start your historical simulations, and the most recent year for which there is data available is 2019, then nyears equals 45.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 50</span>

**Spat_targ**: Distribution of fishing in relation to vulnerable biomass (VB) across areas. The distribution of fishing effort is proportional to VB^Spat_targ. Upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This parameter allows the user to model either avoidance or spatial targeting behavior by the fleet. If the parameter value is 1, fishing effort is allocated across areas in proportion to the population density of that area. Values below 1 simulate an avoidance behavior and values above 1 simulate a targeting behavior.

### Trend in historical fishing effort (exploitation rate), interannual variability in fishing effort: EffYears, EffLower, EffUpper, Esd

**EffYears**: Vector indicating the historical years where there is information available to infer the relative fishing effort expended.This vector is specified in terms of the position of the year in the vector rather than the calendar year. For example, say our simulation starts with an unfished stock in 1975,and the current year (the last year for which there is data available) is 2019. Then there are 45 historical years simulated, and EffYears should include numbers between 1 and 45. Note that there may not be information available for every historical year, especially for data poor fisheries. In these situations, the EffYears vector should include only the positions of the years for which there is information, and the vector may be shorter than the total number of simulated historical years (nyears).

Borrowed from: Generic_Increasing effort 




**EffLower**: Lower bound on relative fishing effort corresponding to EffYears. EffLower must be a vector that is the same length as EffYears describing how fishing effort has changed over time. Information on relative fishing effort can be entered in any units provided they are consistent across the entire vector because the data provided will be scaled to 1 (divided by the maximum number provided).

Borrowed from: Generic_Increasing effort 




**EffUpper**: Upper bound on relative fishing effort corresponding to EffYears. EffUpper must be a vector that is the same length as EffYears describing how fishing effort has changed over time. Information on relative fishing effort can be entered in any units provided they are consistent across the entire vector because the data provided will be scaled to 1 (divided by the maximum number provided).

A value of 1 indicates that 100% of fish are selected at the asymptotic length, and the selection curve is logistic. If Vmaxlen is less than 1 the selection curve is dome shaped. For example, if Vmaxlen is 0.4, then only 40% of fish are vulnerable to the fishing gear at the asymptotic length.

Cobs requires upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution, and for each simulation a CV is sampled from this distribution. Each CV is used to specify a log-normal error distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation equal to the sampled CV.
