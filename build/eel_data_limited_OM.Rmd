# Introduction



## Completing the OM Documentation

This document is used to generate a HTML OM report document.



The document is separated into 7 sections:

1. Introduction (this section)

2. Custom Parameters (optional)

3. Stock Parameters

4. Fleet Parameters

5. Obs (Observation) Parameters

6. Imp (Implementation) Parameters

7. References



The Introduction section is used to briefly describe the fishery and the details of the Operating Model.

It should include an explanation for the OM parameters:

 * nsim: the number of simulations.

 * proyears: the number of projectio years.

 * interval: the management interval.

 * pstar: the percentile of the sample of the management recommendation for each method.

 * maxF: the maximum instantaneous fishing mortality rate that may be simulated for any given age class.

 * reps: the number of samples of the management recommendation for each method.



The Custom Parameters section is optional and should only be included if the cpars feature of DLMtool is used in the OM.

Delete both the heading and the text in this section if `cpars` are not used.



The Stock, Fleet, Obs, and Imp sections include each slot in these components of the OM object.

Provide details (including references where applicable) for the choice of values for each slot below the corresponding slot name (e.g., ## M).

For example: 

**M**

An explanation for the values of the natural mortality rate in the OM (Smith et al. 1999).



You do not need to include the actual values from the OM. These will be included automatically in the final compiled document.



References should be included in the 'References' section at the end of the document.



Once complete, this text file will be compiled into an OM Report Document.

This text file is linked to the Excel spreadsheet that was generated with the same file name.

It serves as a single documentation source for a DLMtool OM, and should be updated whenever parameter values in the OM spreadsheet are updated.



## Tips on filling this Document



This document is uses the Markdown format. All first and second level headings have been provided, and in general you

should only need to enter plain text.



You can have multiple paragraphs throughout the document.



The Introduction and Custom Parameters sections also support second and third level headings.



## An example Second level heading



### An example third level heading



### Technical Tip



This document will be compiled into Rmarkdown, and then a HTML document using Pandoc. Equations can be included by



using Latex (see [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Mathematical_expressions) for some examples).

# Stock Parameters 

### Mortality and age:  maxage, R0, M, Msd

**maxage**: The maximum age of individuals that is simulated. There are maxage+1 (recruitment to age-0) age classes in the storage matrices. maxage is the plus group where all age-classes > maxage are grouped, unless option switched off with OM@cpars$plusgroup=0 . Single value. Positive integer.

**R0**: Initial number of unfished recruits to age-0. This number is used to scale the size of the population to match catch or data, but does not affect any of the population dynamics unless the OM has been conditioned with data. As a result, for a data-limited fishery any number can be used for R0 . In data-rich stocks R0 may be estimated as part of a stock assessment, but for data limited stocks users can choose either an arbitrary number (say, 1000) or choose a number that produces simulated catches in recent historical years that are similar to real world catch data. Single value. Positive real number.

Borrowed from: Data-limited training 




**L50_95**: Difference in lengths between 50% and 95% maturity. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. The value drawn is then added to the length at 50% maturity to determine the length at 95% maturity. This parameterization is used instead of specifying the size at 95 percent maturity to avoid situations where the value drawn for the size at 95% maturity is smaller than that at 50% maturity.

Borrowed from: Data-limited training 




**Frac_area_1**: The fraction of the unfished biomass in area 1. Please specify numbers between 0 and 1. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. For example, if Frac_area_1 is 0.5, then 50% of the unfished biomass is allocated to area 1, regardless of the size of area 1 (i.e, size and fraction in each area determine the density of fish, which may impact fishing spatial targeting).

# Fleet Parameters 

### Historical years of fishing, spatial targeting: nyears, Spat_targ

**nyears**: The number of years for the historical simulation. Single value.

**Spat_targ**: Distribution of fishing in relation to vulnerable biomass (VB) across areas. The distribution of fishing effort is proportional to VB^Spat_targ. Upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided.

### Trend in historical fishing effort (exploitation rate), interannual variability in fishing effort: EffYears, EffLower, EffUpper, Esd

**EffYears**: Vector indicating the historical years where there is information available to infer the relative fishing effort expended.This vector is specified in terms of the position of the year in the vector rather than the calendar year. For example, say our simulation starts with an unfished stock in 1975,and the current year (the last year for which there is data available) is 2019. Then there are 45 historical years simulated, and EffYears should include numbers between 1 and 45. Note that there may not be information available for every historical year, especially for data poor fisheries. In these situations, the EffYears vector should include only the positions of the years for which there is information, and the vector may be shorter than the total number of simulated historical years (nyears).

Borrowed from: Data-limited training 




**EffLower**: Lower bound on relative fishing effort corresponding to EffYears. EffLower must be a vector that is the same length as EffYears describing how fishing effort has changed over time. Information on relative fishing effort can be entered in any units provided they are consistent across the entire vector because the data provided will be scaled to 1 (divided by the maximum number provided).

Borrowed from: Data-limited training 




**EffUpper**: Upper bound on relative fishing effort corresponding to EffYears. EffUpper must be a vector that is the same length as EffYears describing how fishing effort has changed over time. Information on relative fishing effort can be entered in any units provided they are consistent across the entire vector because the data provided will be scaled to 1 (divided by the maximum number provided).

# Obs Parameters 

### Catch statistics: Cobs, Cbiascv, CAA_nsamp, CAA_ESS, CAL_nsamp, CAL_ESS

**Cobs**: Observation error around the total catch. Observation error in the total catch is expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV). Cobs requires upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution, and for each simulation a CV is sampled from this distribution. Each CV is used to specify a log-normal error distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation equal to the sampled CV. The yearly observation error values for the catch data are then drawn from this distribution. For each time step the simulation model records the true catch, but the observed catch is generated by applying this yearly error term (plus any bias, if specified) to the true catch.

Borrowed from: Data-limited training 




**Cbiascv**: Log-normally distributed coefficient of variation controlling the sampling bias in observed catch for each simulation. Bias occurs when catches are systematically skewed away from the true catch level (for example, due to underreporting of catch or undetected illegal catches). Cbiascv is a single value specifying the standard deviation of a log-normal distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation equal to the sampled CV. For each simulation a bias value is drawn from this distribution, and that bias is applied across all years.
